This is another create-react-app project I built.

This exercise was useful in my understanding of how React works with forms. Passing down methods from the parent component and invoking them from within the child is taking some getting used to for me, the logic makes perfect sense. This project also helped my understanding of why controlled components need to maintain their own state and retain complete control over forms. I'm starting to get very comfortable using onChange to manage that state within these controlled components.
